  <h1 align="center">iOS Tweak Developer Tools</h1>
  <h3 align="center">    A collection of tools geared towards iOS Jailbreak Tweak Developers. This repository's README includes links to a bunch of tools I think are useful and have found and would like to share with you. I take no credit for any of these tools apart from the ones I developed. If this repo helped you make sure to star it so other's will be able to find it easier.</h3>
  </br><h3 align="center">Some of these may be for certain systems only. For most compatibility it's recommended to use a Mac.</h3>

# The Necessities:

Programs and Site under this chapter I consider necessary to familiarize yourseld with for tweak development if you want to take it seriously.

- [Theos: A cross-platform suite of tools for building and deploying software for iOS and other platforms.](https://theos.github.io)
- [Simject: A command-line tool and iOS dynamic library that allows developers to easily test their tweaks on the iOS Simulator.](https://github.com/angelXwind/simject)
- [TheiPhoneDevWiki: Wiki site for all your questions and interests in anything to do with iPhone/Jailbreak development.](https://iphonedevwiki.net/index.php/Main_Page)
- [StackOverflow: A great site to find answers to literally any question you have about programming. It always helps to do a google search before getting frustrated](https://stackoverflow.com)

#### IDEs and Text Editors:

- [Visual Studio Code: My personal favorite text editor, VSC offers a plethora of plugins and support for multiple languages. Plus it's cross-platform and works on any system.](https://code.visualstudio.com)
- [XCode: Obviously needed for any type of iOS or macOS development. You're bound to have to install XCode just to get theos running so make sure to have this if you're on a mac. It also comes with it's own text editor but it isn't that great.](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
- [Atom: An electron based text editor run and maintained by GitHub. This is my 2nd favorite text editor out there and it too offers optimal plugin support and customization.](https://atom.io)

# Useful Resources:

These programs and projects under this chapter are useful in most situations but I wouldn't consider them necessary.

- [Limneos Headers Directory: A website that will show you any header for any jailbreakable iOS at the moment. At the time of writing this it's only up to 11.1.2.](http://developer.limneos.net/index.php)
- [Yalu10: Yalu is a great Open Source jailbreak to check out if you want to get into actually developing a jailbreak.](https://github.com/shaungall/yalu10)

# Tweak Libraries:

These following libraries are very useful when creating tweaks.

- [KarenPrefs: A preference library made by angelXwind. Commonly used.](https://github.com/angelXwind/KarenPrefs)
- [libCephei: A preference library made by the Hashbang team.](https://github.com/hbang/libcephei)
- [libCSPreferences: A great preference library that supercharges your preferences tab.](https://github.com/CreatureSurvive/libCSPreferences)
- [libCSColorPicker: Another great library for preferences or tweaks that allow for a color picker.](https://github.com/CreatureSurvive/libCSColorPicker)
- [CSPreferences: A framework for preferences using libCSPreferences and libCSColorPicker](https://github.com/CreatureSurvive/CSPreferences)
